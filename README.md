Udacity Frontend Nanodegree, Project 2: Online Resume

## Description:

To build a resume dynamically using JavaScript (with JSON objects for data) and jQuery, as popposed to static HTML.


## ToDo:

* Add D3 graph for skills
* Nicer more appealing styles
* Look into Google Maps JS API to find out if it there is any way to add more than 10 Places

(with my recent holidays and the milestone date so close, I didn't really have mmuch time to invest in the "nice" features).
